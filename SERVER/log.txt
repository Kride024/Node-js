if you are making new project from start then you can go on this

// JSON : javascript object notation

// we give data as raw in jSON further frontend (React , mobile -> it may made in flutter , browser) 
further frontend can decide what he wants to do with data.

// you should know tumhara client kon hai like google know ki it has to open on browser so it send html , nahi toh kaam baad jata hai 

// raw data send -> render on client but for cross platform we have to send jSON , further frontend team will handle how to show this data


// you should know both server and client are different thing


Restful api guidelines:-
1. always respect server client architecture and remember both are different
(HTML in node js we send from server)
2. always respect all http methods
 GET POST PUT Patch DELETE
GET/user - users data read karo and return data
POST/user - handle new user creation
Patch/user - update the user 

Future Plan :- 
MERN : JSON data we will send
